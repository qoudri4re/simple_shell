# Simple Shell with C

This is the implementation of shell command using c programming language

In this project we are tasked with creating our own simple UNIX command interpreter. The program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output. The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0].
